# thinkBot

This is a note-taking app with an integrated **AI chatbot**. By using the **ChatGPT API**, **vector embeddings**, and **Pinecone**, the chatbot knows about all notes stored in your user account and can retrieve relevant information to answer your questions and summarize information.

The app is built with Next.js 14's app router, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI, and TypeScript. It has a light/dark theme toggle and a fully mobile-responsive layout.
